 Section 1: System Requirements
******************************************

	This project was made using C# .NET Windows Forms
	using .NET framework 4.0 and 4.5 components. Therefore,
	.NET framework 4.0 must be installed on the OS.
	*Note - I am unsure if this will run on a Mac.

******************************************
 Section 2: Setting up files
******************************************

	The Program can be executed by clicking on <path to .exe goes here>
        in the root folder.

        To run or view the source code, open up the project by
        clicking Graphics Term Project.sln in the root folder in
        Visual Studio 2012. *Note if you are using Visual Studio
        2010, you must open it with .csproj within the
        appliation folder.

******************************************
 Section 3: GUI Overview
******************************************

	The GUI is separated into 4 main sections that will be referenced in
	the reset of the readme file.

	Top Menu Bar: This is the Menu bar on the upper-most part of the program.
	 this contains menu items for file operations, adding shapes, adding
	 lights, and <are we adding terrain?>

	Left Control Area: This is the left side of the screen where multiple
         controls are displayed.

	Right Control Area: This is the right side of the screen where multiple
         controls are displayed.

	Middle Panel Area: Located in the middle of the screen is the main panel
	 where the scene is displayed.
