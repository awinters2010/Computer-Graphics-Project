******************************************
 Section 1: System Requirements
******************************************

	This project was made using C# .NET Windows Forms
	using .NET framework 4.0 and 4.5 components. Therefore,
	.NET framework 4.0 must be installed on the OS.
	*Note - Will only run on Windows (presumably Vista and higher).

******************************************
 Section 2: Setting up files
******************************************

	The root folder is called Computer Graphics Term Project. In this folder there are two folders called Graphics
         Project Runnable-Executable, which has a runnable version of the program, and Graphics Project Source Code, 
         which is the source code.
	
	The Program can be executed by clicking on Computer Graphics Term Project.exe in Computer Graphics Term
          Project/Graphics Project Runnable-Executable.

	To run or view the source code, open up the project by
	double clicking Graphics Term Project.sln in Computer Graphics Term Project/Graphics Project Source Code. 
         This will open Visual Studio 2010 or 2012 depending on your version. 
	
	*Note: If you have issues opening it with the .sln then open the Compiling folder and double click 
          Compiling.csproj.

******************************************
 Section 3: GUI Overview
******************************************

	The GUI is separated into 4 main sections that will be referenced in
	the reset of the readme file.

	Top Menu Bar: This is the Menu bar on the upper-most part of the program.
	 this contains menu items for file operations, adding shapes, and adding
	 lights.

	Left Control Area: This is the left side of the screen where multiple
         controls are displayed.

	Right Control Area: This is the right side of the screen where multiple
         controls are displayed.

	Middle Panel Area: Located in the middle of the screen is the main panel
	 where the scene is displayed.
